The drawing below gives an idea of how to cut a given "true" rectangle into squares ("true" rectangle meaning that the two dimensions are different).

Can you translate this drawing into an algorithm?

You will be given two dimensions
  a positive integer length
  a positive integer width

Examples in general form:
  sqInRect(5, 3) should return [3, 2, 1, 1]
  sqInRect(3, 5) should return [3, 2, 1, 1]
